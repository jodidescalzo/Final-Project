        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a beginner programmer from Mt. Eden High School. I have been briefly exposed to coding in my life before taking AP Computer Science. Back in 2020, I took a Computer Apps class in middle school for a semester.</p>
        <p>I knew that programming was going to be complicated so I'm not surprised that I had difficulty keeping up in AP Comp Sci. It was delightful and accomplishing to create these projects, though.</p>
